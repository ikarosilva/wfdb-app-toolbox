function varargout=wfdbtool(varargin)

 [stat,browser,url]=wfdbtool(recordName,N,N0,systemBrowser)

  MATLAB interface to PhysioNet's LightWAVE. LightWAVE is a lightweight
  waveform and annotation viewer and editor. You can use it to view any of
  the recordings of physiologic signals and time series in PhysioNet,
  together with their annotations (event markers).

  NOTE: This tool is currently supported only in MATLAB 2013b or higher. On some system
      (such as Linux) the MATLAB default browser may not worker properly
      with LightWAVE. In this case you may want to try setting the
      'systemBrowser' to 1 (true).

 Required Input Parameters:

 recorName
       String specifying the name of the record in the WFDB path or
       in the current directory.

 Optional Input Parameters are:

 N
       A 1x1 integer specifying the sample number at which to stop displaying the
       record file. Default is enough samples to cover 10 seconds.
 N0
       A 1x1 integer specifying the sample number at which to start displaying the
       record file (default 1 = first sample).Default is beginning of
       record.

 systemBrowser
      A 1x1 boolean. If true, uses the system browser. Default = 0.


 Optional Outputs are:

 stat
     A  returns the status of the web command in the variable STAT. STAT = 0 indicates successful execution. STAT = 1
     indicates that the browser was not found. STAT = 2 indicates that the
     browser was found, but could not be launched.

 browser
     Returns a handle to the last active web browser.

 url
     Returns the URL of the current location.
