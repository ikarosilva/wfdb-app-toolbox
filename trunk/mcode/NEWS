0.9.9 (February 1, 2015)
       Added a GUI for viewing and processing WFDB records and annotation:
       WFDBRECORDVIEWER. Several bug fixes.
0.9.8 (December 1, 2014)
	   Several features added and bug fixes. New implementation of the EDR function
	   by Sara Mariani. Removed WFDBUPDATE and SCORE2013. Added the following new functions : 
	   CORRINT, DFA, PBSEARCH, SURROGATE, VISGRAPH, and WFDBTOOL.
	   
0.9.7 (October 8, 2014)
       Updated WFDB library to 10.5.24. Added method to change the Toolbox binary path at runtime.
       Added data integrity check in RDSAMP and added extra data type options. 
       Improved performance in WRANN, and WFDBTIME. Changed API in PHYSIONETDB.
       Fixed issues with ECPUWAVE reading annotations passed through signalList. Removed 
       STDERR from input stream when parsing system calls. Fixed issue with RDANN 
       returning channels in with 0 indexing. WFDBTEST now also checks if user is running 
       on supported version of MATLAB or Mac OS X. 

0.9.6.1 (February 10, 2014):
	Minor bug fixes with JAR files loading libraries.

0.9.6 (February 6, 2014):
	Added support to GNU Octave version 3.6.4 (requires Octave Java package). 
	Added single, and fixed point, and higher precision options to RDSAMP. 
	Added a system wide WFDB path configuration to WFDBLOADLIB. The default 
	search is now the current directory, {WFDB_HOME}/database, and http:physionet/physiobank/database. 
	So databases can be stored in a single centralized location on the user's machine
	({WFDB_HOME}/database). Added the function WOODY (average with alignment), and HTML
	help files.

0.9.5 (December 6, 2013):
	Updated native libs to WFDB 10.5.22. Added WFDBEXEC 
	(runs WFDB native commands in their native API and by a system call through the JVM), 
    EDR, GQRS, MSENTROPY. Added framework for users who want to run their own custom version
    of the WFDB native binaries. Any user who can successfully compile and run WFDB executables 
    on their system should be able to use most functionality of this toolbox provided that 
    they install the binaries in the '/mcode/nativelibs/custom' directory (see README for details).
    Added WDFB and WFDBCAL environment variables and ability to set and change them. Added 
    system wide debugging information and variable to allow configuration of maximum network
    waiting time (default = 1 second).
