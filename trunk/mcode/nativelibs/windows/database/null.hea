# This is a "null record", readable by any application built using WFDB library
# version 9.1 or later.  There are no signal files associated with this
# record (the `*' in the signal specification lines above has no special
# significance).  If read, this record appears to have 1800 samples (5 seconds
# at 360 Hz) in each of two signals, and all samples are zero.  If this record
# is used as a template for output (e.g., using osigopen("null", ...)), any
# samples "written" using putvec() are discarded.
