%  WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) Toolbox 
%  Version 0.9.6.1
% 
%  Last Updated February 10, 2014
%
%
%This is a set of MATLAB functions and wrappers for reading, writing, and processing
%files in the formats used by PhysioBank databases (among others). 
%The WFDB Toolbox has support for reading public PhysioNet databases directly from 
%web. This feature allows your code to analyze a wide range of physiological 
%signals available from PhysioBank without the need to download entire 
%records and to store them locally. This toolbox is distributed under the LGPL
%license (see LICENSE.txt file in this directory). For more informationa about the
