function varargout=wfdbexec(varargin)
 
  [output]=wfdbexec(commandName,inputArguments,logLevel)
  [nativeCommands]=wfdbexec()
 
  Executes a WFDB native command ('commandName'), with input arguments
  given by 'inputArguments', and outputs everything into a cell array
  called 'output'. The execution is done through a system call outside of
  MATLAB. If no input arguments are provided to the function, the
  output is an array list of all available native WFDB commands in this OS.
  Substantial, non-trivial text parsing maybe required for processing the
  output into a useful MATLAB numerical variable.
 
  WFDBEXEC is useful in cases where a specific command, or feature for a
  command, is not yet in implemented in the MATLAB wrapper. This function
  may be useful for those wishing to do some debugging or performance comparisons.
 
  The user should be very careful when using this command. The user should
  be familiar with the input and output arguments of the native command
  that he/she is using. In some cases, information about the command can be
  obtained by running the command by itself, of with either '-h',
  '-help','--help' as input arguments in order to access the command help
  information. Of course, you can also look at the man page or source code
  for the command at http://www.physionet.org/.
 
 
 
  Required Parameters:
 
  commandName
        String specifying the command to be called. To ge a list of
        available WFDB commands that may be runnable by system calls run
        this function by itself:
                [nativeCommands]=wfdbexec();
 
  inputArguments
        Cell array of strings specifying the inputArguments to the command.
        Each command flag is an element on the cell array. Command flags
        that require additional parameters should be followed by another
        String element with the required parameter(s). In cases you are
        using a command that is already implements in a MATLAB wrapper, it
        maybe helpful to look at that command's MATLAB code.
 
  Optional Parameters:
 
        logLevel
        1x1 integer that specifies the log level (verbosity) of the execution process.
        Options are:
                      0 OFF (Default)
                      1 SEVERE
                      2 WARNING
                      3 INFO
                      4 FINEST
                      5 ALL
 
  Output:
 
  output
        Nx1 Cell array list of Strings.

  %Get a  list of all WFDB native executables
  nativeComands=wfdbexec()
 
  %Get help on RDSAMP
  out=wfdbexec('rdsamp',{'-h'})
 
  %Read the first five samples of a record
  %Note: This will be very inefficient because we are not buffering
  %and we are returning a list of Strings (instead of doubles and ints).
  %This is provided just as an example on how WFDBEXEC works.
  out=wfdbexec('rdsamp',{'-r','mitdb/100','-t','s5'})
