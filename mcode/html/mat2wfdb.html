function [varargout]=mat2wfdb(varargin)
 
  [xbit]=mat2wfdb(X,fname,Fs,bit_res,adu,info,gain,sg_name,baseline,isquant, isdigital)
 
  Convert data from a matlab array into PhysioNet WFDB format file.
 
  Input Parameter are:
 
  X       -(required)  NxM matrix of M signals with N samples each. The
                       signals can be of type double.The signals are assumed to be
                       in physical units already and will be converted to
                       ADU.
  fname   -(required)  String where the the header (*.hea) and data (*.dat)
           files will be saved (one single name for both, with no suffix).
  Fs      -(Optional)  1x1 sampling frequency in Hz (all signals must have
           been sampled at the same frequency). Default is 1 Hz.
  bit_res -(Optional)  1xM (or Mx1):scalar determining the bit depth of the conversion for
                       each signal.
                       1x1 : If all the signals should have the same bit depth
           Options are: 8,  16, and 32 ( all are signed types). 16 is the default.
  adu     -(Optional) Describes the physical units (default is 'mV').
           Three input formats:
             - String delimited by forward slashes (e.g. 'V/mV/mmHg'), with
             M-1 slash characters
             - Single string (e.g. 'V'), in which case all signals will 
             have the same physical units.
             - Cell array of strings, where the total units entered has to equal M 
             (number of channels).
  info    -(Optional)  String that will be added to the comment section of the header file.
            For multi-lined comments, use a cell array of strings. Each
            cell will be output on a new line. Note that comments in the
            header file are automatically prefixed with a pound symbol (#)
  gain    -(Required for digital only) Scalar or Mx1 array of floats indicating the difference in sample values 
            that would be observed if a step of one physical unit occurred in the original 
            analog signal. If the 'isdigital' field is 1, this field is mandatory. Otherwise,
            this field is ignored if present. 
  baseline -(Required for digital only) Mx1 array of integers that specifies the sample value for each channel
            corresponding to 0 physical units. Not to be confused with 'ADC zero' which 
            is currently always taken and written as 0 in this function. If
            the 'isdigital' field is 1, this field is mandatory. Otherwise,
            this field is ignored if present. 
  sg_name -(Optional) Cell array of strings describing signal names.
 
  isquant   -(Optional) Logical value (default=0). Use this option if the
            input signal is already quantized and you want to remove round-off
            error by mapping the original values to integers prior to fixed
            point conversion. This field is only used for input physical
            signals. If 'isdigital' is set to 1, this field is ignored.
 
  isdigital -(Optional) Logical value (default=0). Specifies whether the input signal is 
             digital or physical (default). If it is digital, the signal values will be 
             directly written to the file without scaling. If the signal is physical, 
             the optimal gain and baseline will be calculated and used to digitize the signal
             to write the WFDB file. This flag also decides the allowed
             input combinations of the 'gain' and 'baseline' fields.
             Digital signals must have both, and physical signals must have
             neither (as the ideal values will be automatically calculated). 
 
  Output Parameter:
 
  xbit    -(Optional)  NxM the quantized signals that written to file (possible
           rescaled if no gain was provided at input). Useful for comparing
           and estimating quantization error with the input double signal X
           (see examples below).
 
 
   NOTE: The signals can have different amplitudes, they will all be scaled to
   a reference gain, with the scaling factor saved in the *.hea file.
