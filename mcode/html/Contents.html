WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) Toolbox 


 This is a set of MATLAB functions and wrappers for reading, writing, and processing
 files in the formats used by PhysioBank databases (among others).
 The WFDB Toolbox has support for reading public PhysioNet databases directly from
 web. This feature allows your code to analyze a wide range of physiological
 signals available from PhysioBank without the need to download entire
 records and to store them locally. This toolbox is distributed under the LGPL
 license (see LICENSE.txt file in this directory). For more information about the
 toolbox please go to: http://www.physionet.org
