usage: $0 CMPFILE [ CMPFILE ... ]

Use this script to convert one or more records from an AHA DB CDROM into
WFDB format.  The converted files are written into the current directory.

One or more CMPFILEs (files from the CD-ROM with the suffix .CMP or .cmp)
must be named on the command line.  Unless you have copied the CMPFILEs
and the associated .ANO files into the current directory, include the path
information needed to locate these files, as shown in the examples below.

Examples:
   $0 /mnt/cdrom/3001.CMP /mnt/cdrom/3002.CMP
      [converts records 3001 and 3002]

   $0 /mnt/cdrom/*.CMP
      [converts all records found on the CD-ROM]

   $0 /mnt/cdrom/?2??.CMP
      [converts all short-format (35-minute) records found on the CD-ROM]

For each .CMP file, this script creates a header (.hea) file, a signal (.dat)
file, and a reference annotation (.atr) file (created from the corresponding
.ANO file) within the current directory.
