# This header file is a sample of a multi-segment record.  The first line
# contains the record name ("multi"), the number of segments (3), the number
# of signals (2; this must be the same in each segment), the sampling frequency
# (360), and the total length of the record in sample intervals (45000;  this
# must be the sum of the segment lengths).
#
# The second line contains the record name ("100s") of the first segment of the
# record, and its length in sample intervals (21600).  The third and fourth
# lines contain the record names and lengths of the remaining segments.  The
# remaining lines are comments.

# Note that a segment may appear more than once in a multi-segment record, as
# in this sample, and that storage formats may vary between segments (the
# second segment is a "null" record, containing format 0 "signals", and the
# others are written in format 8).
#
# This record may be read by any WFDB application built using WFDB library
# version 9.1 or later;  the application need not be aware that this is a
# multi-segment record.  Earlier versions of the WFDB library do not support
# multi-segment records (or format 0 signals).
