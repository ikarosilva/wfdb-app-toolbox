# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to compile ecgpuwave.  Install
# the WFDB library (see http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml), and
# copy wfdbf.c from the 'fortran' subdirectory of the WFDB sources into this
# directory, before attempting to compile ecgpuwave.
#
# 21 July 2013 (GBM):
# Incorporated modifications to dades.f, ecgpuwave.f, and this Makefile for
# compatibility with gfortran (thanks to Roberto Sassi!)
#
# 24 March 2010 (GBM):
# The -m32 option for F77 and CC forces compilation of 32-bit executables,
# even on a 64-bit platform, because 64-bit executables of ecgpuwave fail
# due to a mismatch in the default sizes of integer variables in Fortran and
# int variables in C.  This can probably be remedied by declaring all
# of ecgpuwave's integer variables as INTEGER*8 when compiling a 64-bit
# executable, but that would cause worse problems on 32-bit platforms.
# This has been tested using g77 and gcc on 32- and 64-bit Linux (Fedora 12).
# If your 32-bit compilers don't support the -m32 option, remove it.
